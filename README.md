# A companion for your Elite: Dangerous journey

This project is starting as a statistics companion for an exploration journey in Elite: Dangerous, specifically with the question "_How far from the bubble do I need to travel to find systems never before explored_".

Other questions I hope to answer by the end of this journey include:
- What's the monetary difference between journeying with short jump vs long jump (which I can estimate I've done Angya before);
- If we scan the most profitable system bodies, how long does it take to get to a certain amount of money;
- If we want to keep this infrastructure on a personal AWS account, how much does it cost;
